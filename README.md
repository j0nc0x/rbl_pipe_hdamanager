This repo contains modules relating to the HDA Manager. This is a tool that is designed to be used within Houdini and covers the following basic features:
- Load HDAs from source controlled repositories.
- Make edits to HDAs.
- Push editted HDAs back to source control.

All of these operations are possible by any user and do not require any programming / source control experience.

This documentation will cover both user and developer documentation.
